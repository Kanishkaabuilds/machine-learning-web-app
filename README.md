The Machine Learning Web App! 

This application allows users to explore different machine learning classifiers using various datasets.

## Features

- Select from popular datasets (Iris, Breast Cancer, Wine, Diabetes, Heart Disease).
- Choose from different classifiers (KNN, SVM, Random Forest).
- Visualize the results with PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Display accuracy metrics for the selected classifiers.

## Datasets

The following datasets are available in this application:
- **Iris**: Classic dataset for classification tasks.
- **Breast Cancer**: A dataset for predicting breast cancer diagnosis.
- **Wine**: A dataset for wine classification based on chemical analysis.
- **Diabetes**: A dataset for predicting diabetes onset.
- **Heart Disease**: A dataset for predicting the presence of heart disease.

## Classifiers

This application supports the following classifiers:
- **KNN**: K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machine Classifier.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble classifier using decision trees.
